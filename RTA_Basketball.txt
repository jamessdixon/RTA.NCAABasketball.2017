Null hypothsis - predict outcome based on rank
Selection committee looks at what is deserved, not on probability of future
	(#1 seed best player hurt on Wednesday)
	so you can get upsets
Vegas - massive delphi panel based on odds (book is priced for action)
Historical - not that many data points.  Confounding varaibles
Hunch Model for champion
	Hot team: UCONN with Walker and Napier, Nova last year
	Growing team: Kentucky with Freshman
	NBA team: UNLV
	All Games: Historical Precident + Conference + Loyality	
	Is picking the champion important: weighted average of points

Biggest problem is data aquisition - most is designed for visuization
Model selection is less important than feature selection

My Model:
Simulation of
Vegas Odds
Last 10 games win/loss: weighted moving avaerage
Turnovers/easy buckets: matchups, officals, guard experience (esp point)
Coaching: Proxy for cofounding varaibles
